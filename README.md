# Prepare the Data
-Use the StandardScaler() module from scikit-learn to normalize the data from the CSV file.

-Create a DataFrame with the scaled data and set the "coin_id" index from the original DataFrame as the index for the new DataFrame.






# Process

Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Scaled DataFrame

Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Scaled Data

Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis

Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data

Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data
